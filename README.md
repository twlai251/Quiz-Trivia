# Quiz Trivia

Using Android Studios and Kotlin to create a trivia quiz app.

In the quiz, there are 10 questions that is randomly generated from a pool of questions. 
Once the user chooses an answer to a question and hit submit, the app will notify the user if the answer is correct or not.
If the answer is incorrect, it will reveal the correct answer. After 10 questions have been answered, the app will show how many questions the user got right.
The app will then allow the user to play the trivia quiz again with different questions.
